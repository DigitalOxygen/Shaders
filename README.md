# Shaders
A collection of shaders written in CG/ShaderLab for Unity.

BetterTransparentDiffuse.shader
------
The default Unity shader for transparent objects suffers from some overlapping issues on complex objects. This shader fixes the problem by rendering the object in two passes. <br /> <br />

DiffuseTwoSided.shader
------
Sometimes you want to render both sides of an object (for example, if it's not totally convex or perhaps it's an animated plane used for a flag). <br /> <br />
